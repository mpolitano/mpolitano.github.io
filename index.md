### About Me

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
	I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at the Software Engineering and Formal Methods Group at National University of Rio Cuarto. Advised by Dr. Nazareno Aguirre and Dr Germán Regis. I was honored with a PhD CONICET (Argentina’s National Scientific and Technical Research Council) fellowship.
	<br>
	I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Rio Cuarto National University.
	<br>
	<br>
	My research interests lies in the general area of Software Engineering, particularly in automatic test generation. This research is based on recent studies which found that good levels of code coverage are not correlated with the ability to detect real errors in software, but when the test suites have a good capacity for mutant detection, in general they are also good for detecting real errors. 
	This motive my research topic that is definition of specific techniques for the automatic tests construction. This involves using symbolic execution techniques, test suites minimization, constraint solving, among others.
